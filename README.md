# UserManagementApi
Microsoft Back-End Developer Professional Certicate [course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-back-end-developer) on Coursera. This project is for the Backend course which I was required to create a user management api using ASP.NET Core and Microsoft Copilot. 

The user management implements CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete). I used middleware for authenication, error handling, and logging.
